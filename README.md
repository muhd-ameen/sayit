# SayIt

**[sayit.avocadonation.xyz](https://sayit.avocadonation.xyz)**

A tiny macOS menu bar utility that refines messages before you send them, without switching to ChatGPT or disrupting your flow.

Press **⌥ Space** anywhere. Type your draft. Get three polished variants instantly. Copy. Done.

---

## Features

- **Global hotkey.** ⌥ Space opens the panel from any app
- **Three tone slots.** Default, Shorter, Professional (fully customizable)
- **Nudge.** Iterate on a result with a one-line instruction
- **Context field.** Paste a conversation thread so Claude can write the perfect reply
- **Clipboard prefill.** Opens with your clipboard text already loaded
- **Streaming.** Results appear card-by-card as Claude generates them
- **API key in Keychain.** Stored securely, never in plaintext
- **No backend, no account.** Direct Anthropic API call from your Mac

---

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonnet) or later
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com)
- Xcode 15+ or Swift 5.9+ CLI tools

---

## Install

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhd-ameen/sayit
cd sayit
swift build -c release
```

The binary lands at `.build/release/SayIt`. Copy it to `/Applications` for launch-at-login support.

### Run directly

```bash
swift run
```

---

## Setup

On first launch SayIt will ask for your Anthropic API key. It's stored in your macOS Keychain under `SayIt`.

You can also set it via environment variable (useful for development):

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... swift run
```

To update the key later: menu bar icon > **Set API Key…**

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| ⌥ Space | Toggle SayIt |
| ⌘ ↩ | Refine |
| ⌘ N | New / reset |
| ⌘ 1 / 2 / 3 | Copy result |
| ⌘ / | Show shortcuts |
| ⌘ W / Esc | Close |

---

## Customizing tones

Click the gear icon to edit your three tone slots. Each slot has a **label** (shown on the card) and an **instruction** (sent verbatim to Claude).

Defaults:

| Label | Instruction |
|---|---|
| Default | natural, direct voice |
| Shorter | same message, as few words as possible |
| Professional | formal register, polished |

Change them to anything: "Friendly", "Brutal honesty", "Gen Z", whatever fits your workflow.

## How it works

```
⌥ Space
  └─ WindowManager shows floating NSPanel
       └─ PopupView reads context + draft
            └─ ClaudeService streams claude-haiku-4-5
                 └─ JSON response: { "default": "…", "shorter": "…", "professional": "…" }
                      └─ Result cards appear as each field completes
```

No server. No telemetry. One API call per refine.

## Dependencies

- [KeyboardShortcuts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/KeyboardShortcuts): global hotkey registration

---

## Customizing the system prompt

Open `Sources/SayIt/Services/PromptBuilder.swift` and edit `systemPrompt` to match your own voice. The default is intentionally generic.

## Known issues

- **Login item on unsigned builds** — "Launch at login" may silently fail if the app isn't in `/Applications` or was installed without `make install`. Workaround: add manually via System Settings → General → Login Items.
- **Gatekeeper block on first launch** — Downloaded DMG builds are unsigned. Right-click → Open on the first launch to bypass the macOS security prompt.
- **Menu bar icon missing after manual copy** — If you copy `SayIt.app` manually instead of using `make install`, the icon may not appear until you run `xattr -cr /Applications/SayIt.app` and relaunch.
